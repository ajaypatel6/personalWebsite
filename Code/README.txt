             SOME login details for testing (or you can just make an accout)
Username: Admin / Password: admin (has admin:"correct", which is admin)

PRODUCTS are shown on products page properly with criteria, tags are able to be added and shown. 
- INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS have all necesarry info and using AJAX

- WISHLIST is not functional

***
- you are able to SIGN UP and log in, as well as log out, (session cleared) 
the password is also hashed and unhashed to login.
- the cookies are unset, and the logout actually occurs
***
- i could not get the specific log in status, in order to show correct header information
- headers may not be CORRECT, but the actual pages will be. 


- had to have admin show up inappropriately because could not get login status to work(i tried using different html headers, but
i wasnt able to use the cookies, or signing out wouldnt work
*******we are using the page, assuming that everyone is an admin, so all headers are available*****
ADMIN page can add products, (can add images, just need a jpg from my folder somehow and add that jpg in the form.)
**To go to admin page, go to Login and it will be there**
